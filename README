Kitsune-enabled Icecast
=======================

This is a version of the Icecast streaming service patched to support dynamic
updating using Kitsune.

Building
========

To build all versions, run `make` in the root directory. To
build a specific version, `cd icecase-<version>/src && make`.

If Kitsune is not installed in your PATH, the environment variable
KITSUNE_PATH must refer to a valid Kitsune installation (the `bin`
directory of the core Kitsune repository will work).

Icecast's build dependencies are libogg, libvorbis, libxslt, libxml2,
libcurl, libtheora, and libspeex. Build dependencies can be easily
installed on Debian-derived systems by running `apt-get build-dep
icecast2`.

The build process will produce a shared object, `icecast.so`, in each
version subdirectory's `src` directory.

Running
=======

Use the Kitsune driver utility to run the Icecast shared object. 

`driver icecast.so icecast-configuration-file.xml`

Updating
========

To update Icecast, use Kitsune's `doupd` script:

`doupd <icecast pid> <new icecast version.so>`

For a dynamic update to work, the target version must have been built
with the running version specified as its previous version. All
versions of Icecast are, by default, built to update from the last
available version, except the first version, which is built to update
from itself.
